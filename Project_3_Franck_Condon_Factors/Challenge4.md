# Challenge 4: Open source License

## GPL and Apache2.0

### GPL

GNU General Public License a.k.a. GPL is an open source license having strong ideology against 'freedom'. It cannot be easily used for proprietary company therefore open source programmer community can be confident that any of there effort cannot be exploited. From a commercial point of view, it cannot be used in distributable program such as client applications which contains undisclosable intellectual property, because a software which uses GPL licensed software must publicize there source code. Therefore the use of GPL licensed software requires its owner to place it online and prevent them from directly selling it.

### Apache 2.0

Apache 2.0 is a generous license which permits owners of the software that uses Apache 2.0 licensed software to commercialize it without publicize source code. They only need to publicize that the software uses Apache 2.0 licensed software, and must left all copyrights as is. From a commercial point of view, it can be used in client applications.


## Public domain licence and private license

Making a software licensed under public domain have several merits for commercial companies:
- It promotes the use of the software, thus making community around it. If a commercial company have other source of profit, which depends on use of the software, making the community large directly benefits their income.
- It can be a freemium model if the owner develops commercial premium version of it.
- It will be a showcase of technical skill of the company.

Private license are more likely to be used in a field where subtle technical details have great importance, such as chemistry or machinery. In those field, technical know-hows must not be disclosed even in a form of patent.

## Opened & Closed Strategy
Opened & Closed strategy is to be "opened" in the field where expansion of the market is needed, and be "closed" in the field where the profit must be secured. We have to figure out where is the  "core" of the business, then apply different licensing strategy based on the technology.
