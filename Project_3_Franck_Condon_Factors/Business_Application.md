# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application
## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

Calculate a spectroscopic property of molecular, FCF: effects of vibrational mode to transition probability between different electronic states, using different methods.  Methods used include classical algorithm (Hermite poly), quantum algorithm (GBS), and quantum inspired algorithm (Loop hafnian).

We can calculate absorption spectrum of molecule by using FCF. Thus, with GBS or hafnian method, we can speed up the calculation of absorption spectrum.

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

Higher precision and richer feature of vibration spectrometers is always needed.

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

- McPherson
- SOL instruments Ltd
- LightMachinery

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language
